# Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a annual tradition for many programmers. Each day a new programming challenge is unlocked and our task is to solve it. They're Christmas themed, and a great test of your skills, or... if you're sadistic like me, your skills and programming language. Not every challenge willl be in [Fan](https://github.com/tristanisham/fan), but many will. They serve as great example for the language at the time of writing, though I do not guarentee that every script will work by the time you get to it. At the time of writing, Fan is a early-alpha project bound to change. 

Still, if you're interested in how I'd solve my A.O.C. problems, feel free to explore.
